        Add a sporty twist to your date night with "Love-Love." Grab your tennis
        rackets and head over to the tennis courts for an exhilarating game.
        Challenge each other in at least one set of 7 matches. To sweeten the
        deal, the loser gets to choose and pay for the post-tennis drinks.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">How it Works:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Tennis Showdown</span>: Bring out your competitive
          spirit on the tennis court. Engage in at least one set of 7 matches,
          showcasing your tennis skills and enjoying the physical activity
          together.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Post-Game Refreshment</span>: After the tennis
          showdown, head to a nearby spot for post-game drinks. The twist: the
          loser of the match gets to choose the venue and foot the bill for the
          refreshments.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="bold">Tips for Maximum Fun:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Keep the tennis match lighthearted and fun. It's about enjoying the
          game and spending quality time together, not just about winning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regardless of who wins or loses, celebrate the effort put into the
          game. Acknowledge each other's skills and improvements, fostering a
          supportive atmosphere.!
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring water to stay hydrated during the game, especially if you're
          playing in warmer weather. Keeping energy levels up enhances the
          overall experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the tennis match and drinks, take a moment to reflect on the fun
          and laughter shared during the Love-Love date. It's a great
          opportunity to appreciate the joys of being active together.

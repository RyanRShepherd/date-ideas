      <p>
        Elevate your connection and affection with the "Week of Love." This
        unique date involves assigning each other heartfelt love duties to
        complete over the course of a week. It's not a competition but a shared
        challenge, encouraging both partners to give their best effort in
        expressing love through thoughtful actions.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">How it Works:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Assign Love Duties</span>: Decide on a set of love
          duties, one for each day of the week. These could include actions like
          preparing meals, planning a surprise date night, or writing heartfelt
          notes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Daily Exchange</span>: Each day, both partners
          fulfill the assigned love duty for that day. It could be as simple as
          making breakfast, planning a relaxing evening, or performing acts of
          kindness.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Shared Reflection</span>: At the end of the week,
          reflect on the shared experiences. Discuss the highlights, the joyous
          moments, and how the Week of Love strengthened your bond.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="bold">Tips for Maximum Fun:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Tailor the love duties to each other's preferences and interests. This
          personal touch makes the gestures more meaningful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate surprises or unexpected elements into the love duties to
          keep the experience exciting and full of anticipation.

        <li>
          Throughout the week, express gratitude for each other's efforts.

        Embark on an artistic adventure with the Mona Lisa Masterpiece
        Challenge, where love meets the stroke of a pencil! Get ready for
        laughter, creativity, and a dash of friendly competition.
      </p>

      <p class="bold">How it Works:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Design Showdown</span>: Channel your inner Leonardo da Vinci and mutually
          agree upon a design that you both think is both intricate and
          hilarious. It could be anything from a goofy doodle to a miniature
          masterpiece.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">The Battle Arena</span>: Set the stage for your artistic showdown. Grab your
          drawing supplies, find a cozy spot, and prepare for the battle of the
          pencils.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Select the Canvas</span>: Here comes the twist! Instead of paper or canvas,
          choose a part of your partner's body as the canvas. Whether it's a
          forearm, a hand, or even a cheek - get ready to turn your love into a
          work of art.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Race Against Time</span>: Set a timer for the challenge. The catch? You both 
            have a limited time to recreate the chosen design on your partner's chosen canvas. The race is on!
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">The Grand Reveal</span>: Once the timer dings, it's time for the grand reveal. Prepare for fits of laughter 
            as you compare your artistic interpretations. The one who captures the essence of the design most accurately emerges as the Mona Lisa Master!
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="bold">Tips for Maximum Fun:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
            Embrace the mess - art is messy, and so is love!
        </li>
        <li>
            Encourage each other with goofy commentary and compliments throughout the challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't forget to take a snapshot of your doodle magic - memories this funny deserve a spot in your gallery.

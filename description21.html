        Step into the world of glamour and fun with "Makeup-Makeover." Get ready
        for a playful and creative date night where you and your partner switch
        roles, trying your hand at doing each other's makeup. It's time to
        discover who can create the most dazzling (or amusing) look and find out
        who's the sexiest clown alive!
      </p>
      <p class="bold">How it Works:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Cosmetic Canvas</span>: Set up a makeup station
          with a variety of cosmetics, including eyeshadows, lipsticks, and
          brushes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Role Reversal</span>: Take turns being the makeup
          artist and the canvas. One person creates a look on the other, and
          then switch roles.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Unleash Creativity</span>: Experiment with
          different makeup styles - from glamorous to whimsical. Let your
          creativity run wild and embrace the unexpected.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="bold">Tips for Maximum Fun:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Take photos of the final makeup looks for a hilarious and memorable
          keepsake.
        </li>
        <li>
          Opt for specific makeup themes or challenges to make the experience
          even more entertaining.

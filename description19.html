      <p class="bold">Tips for Maximum Fun:</p>

          Engage with the knowledgeable staff at the winery to learn more about
          the wine-making process and the unique characteristics of each
          varietal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring along a small scrapbooking kit to personalize the cork or top
          with additional details and memories from the evening.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a small journal to jot down your thoughts and impressions of
          each wine tasted, adding a personal touch to your wine and dine
          experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy the wine responsibly, and if needed, arrange for a safe and
          convenient transportation option to and from the winery.
